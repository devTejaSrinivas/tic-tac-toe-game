# Things I have learned while making this project : 
    
   1)  Project Structuring
   2)  CSS transitions , responsive design and animations as well as styling as a whole
   3)  Usage of git to clone repos to make changes and then to push those changes back to the repository.
   4)  Better way to use developer tools in browsers
   5)  Still better ways to implement this.
